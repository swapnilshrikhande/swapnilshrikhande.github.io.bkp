It was originally situated outside the town, but the city limits have expanded so that it is now located on the downtown Jangli Maharaj Road. It has been declared as a protected monument by the government.[2]<br>Pataleshwar Caves Internal Temple <br>The temple, made of basalt rock, is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The sanctum - a cube-shaped room about 3–4 metres on each side - houses a linga - the symbol of Shiva and there are two smaller cells on each side. In front of the cave is a circular Nandi mandapa, its umbrella shaped canopy supported by massive square pillars. This mandapa is one of the peculiar structures of Pataleshwar. The cave is located at a lower level than the present level of the road and the cave complex. There is an exquisitely carved circular Nandi shrine in the huge courtyard of the cave. The main cave is rectangular on plan and has a pillared porch. There are three sanctums in the cave temple and the central one houses the Shivalinga. There is a circumambulation path provided in the cave where one can see the unfinished part of the cave temple. It appears that after finishing the front and the sanctum the cave was left incomplete due to some reasons, one of which could be the faults in the rock. However the walls in the main cave have some outlines drawn suggesting the sculptures depicting stories from Indian mythology, especially involving Shiva.<br>The huge complex of the cave has been converted into a garden and there are a few architectural members stored in it probably belonging to some old temple nearby. As this is the oldest monument in Pune, which is over 1300 years old, the Pune office of the Archaeological Survey of India is located in the adjacent property.<br><br><br>Pataleshwar Caves Internal Temple Columns HDR<br>The temple was left incomplete, possibly because of a fault line found at the back of the sanctum sanctorum, which made the further sculpting unsafe, or political upheaval resulting in loss of patronage. Still in use, the linga is anointed with ghee and yogurt. A brass temple bell hangs outside the basalt entryway.</div></td></tr><tr ><th id="277990041R8"  class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" >9</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">8</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Bal Gandharv Rang Mandir</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr ><th id="277990041R9"  class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" >10</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">9</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Mahatma Phule Museum</td><td class="s6 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" ><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZCn23HtqXC42">https://goo.gl/maps/ZCn23HtqXC42</a></div></td><td class="s7"></td></tr><tr style='height:23px;'><th id="277990041R10" style="height: 23px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 23px;">11</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">10</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Bhandarkar Institute

This is a Shiva temple constructed between 1740 to 1760 C.E. by Krishnajipant Chitrav. The temple faces east and has an impressive gateway. There is a Nagarakhana (a small music hall) over the gateway. There is a huge courtyard surrounded by many small rooms, now inhabited by the priests. The courtyard has a Nandi shrine facing the temple. The temple is unique as far as the plan and elevations are concerned. The ceiling of the temple is divided into nine domes constructed with bricks. The sanctum houses a huge Shivalinga. The roof of the temple also appears unusual as instead of one tower there are nine towers above it. The interior of the temple has a number of niches and a few arches that remind one of the medieval Islamic architecture. The area near the temple was a cremation ground earlier. Even today, across the road, there is a place where the post cremation rituals are performed. The temple complex is surrounded by a thick stone masonry wall which had withstood the flood after the breakage of the Panshet dam in 1961. The Nandi mandapa was damaged at that time. Along with the main temple there are many other shrines in the complex like those of Vishnu, Bhavani, Ganesh, Hanuman, Shani etc. the temple is open for the whole day and religious festivals like the Mahashivaratra and Shravani Somvar (Mondays in the month of Shravana) are celebrated with great enthusiasm here.</td></tr><tr ><th id="277990041R13"  class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" >14</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">13</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Raste Wada Datta Mandir

The idol&#39;s status as the premier idol in Pune was decided by Lokmanya Tilak.[1]
<br>
<br>In the year 1630. The Maratha Aristocrat and wife of Shahaji Bhosale, Jijabai Bhosale arrived in Pune with her then infant son, Shivaji, the founder of Maratha Empire. Around this time, along with other seven families, the Thakar Family migrated to Pune from Indi, Vijapur District. Shri Vinayak Bhatt Thakar also carried his Family deity, Lord Gajanan along with him. All these families settled near River bank around the current place of Kasba Ganapati Temple which was close to the residence of Jijabai. Jijabai perceived this as an auspicious moment[citation needed] and promptly decided to build a temple, which is popularly known as the Kasba Ganpati Mandir.
<br>
<br>Since then, Pune is also known as the city of Ganesh. The Peshwas were ardent followers of Lord Ganesh. During their regime Shaniwarwada witnessed grand celebrations for Lord Ganesh.[citation needed]
<br>
<br>In 1893, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the Indian Nationalist Leader, initiated the now famous Ganesh Festival. His intention was to gather people sharing similar ideas and exchange thoughts to deal with the British ruler. He started celebrating Ganesh Festival from his own house called Kesari Wada. Due to his personal popularity and initiative, Ganesh Festival became a public festival soon afterwards.
<br>
<br>There was rivalry among the various mandals regarding the privilege of immersing the idol on the last day of the Ganpati festival. Bal Gangadhar Tilak resolved the rivalry and declared the privilege of immersion to Shri Kasba Ganpati, as it is the local deity of Pune.
<br>
<br>Until 1925, Shri Kasba Ganpati Mandal celebrated the festival within the premises of the temple and from 1926 it has been celebrated in an enclosed mandap. Presently, the ten days of the festival is a platform for local artists to display their talents through various cultural programs thus allowing a large number of devotees to participate in the celebrations. On the last day, Shri Kasba Ganpati plays the leading role during the immersion procession.</div></td></tr><tr ><th id="277990041R15"  class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" >16</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">15</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Ayyappa Temple

A temple for the Goddess was built and it still stands. Since the colour of the idol of Jogeshwari is red, it is called Tambdi (red in Marathi) Jogeshwari. Tilak decided to install an idol of Lord Ganesh there as the temple was very popular.

Kelkar (1896–1990), dedicated to the memory of his only son, Raja.[2] The three-storey building houses various sculptures dating back to the 14th century.[citation needed] There are also ornaments made of ivory, silver and gold, musical instruments (a particularly fine collection),[citation needed] war weapons and vessels. The collection was started around 1920 and by 1960 it contained around 15,000 objects.In 1962, Dr. Kelkar donated his collection to the Government of Maharashtra[citation needed]...
<br>
<br>The museum now holds over 20,000 objects of which 2,500 are on display. These consist of mainly Indian decorative items from everyday life and other art objects, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries. The museum&#39;s collection depicts the skills of the Indian artists of the time.[3]

<br>One part of particular interest is the &quot;Mastani Mahal&quot;. Raja Kelkar made an attempt at depicting the palace of Mastani, (wife of the Peshwa Baji Rao I) with its remnants.

There is a stream called as Nagazari which is very close to it. In fact when the temple was constructed there was a direct approach to the banks of the Nagazari from this temple. The construction of this temple was started on 26th August 1754 C.E. by a person called as Bhimjigiri Gosavi from Dhampur near Indore and was completed in 1770 C.E. There are three inscriptions on the wall of the sanctum of the temple, two of them are in Devanagari script and Sanskrit language and the third one is in the Persian script and language. The first inscription refers to the foundation of Rameshwara and the construction of this temple in 1754 C.E. The second Sanskrit inscription gives a verse from the Bhagvad Geeta. The third inscription that is in Persian informs that a temple of Gurudevadatta was constructed. Presently the temple houses an image of Ganesh with three trunks and six hands and seated on a peacock, which in fact is a rare depiction of this deity. The temple is constructed on a high platform and has a small courtyard from where the entrance to the shrine can be made. The façade of the temple is highly decorated with the depictions of different real and mythological creatures. The entrance is topped by a sculpture of Goddess Lakshmi flanked by two elephants that are shown pouring water from their trunks. The entrance takes one into a hall which further leads one to a passage opening in front of the sanctum. The entrance of the sanctum has many sculptures including a couple of ascetics practising penance. The temple has a basement which can be entered through the staircases constructed in the thick walls of the main entrance. There is an open hall with a couple of platforms and pillars in the basement along with a Samadhi (a memorial) of a Gosavi. There is an inlet for the stream of water also in the basement and hence the basement is generally filled with water. It is not open for everybody except on Gurupournima day, when the basement is cleaned and dried and people can pay homage to the memorial of the ascetic. It is believed that the basement was used as a school for the ascetics who practiced the tantric form of Hinduism. The exteriors of this temple are also well decorated with the images of Shiva, Vishnu, and the Longodbhava depiction of Shiva, as the original plan was to dedicate this temple to Shiva. There are some unique sculptures carved on the façade of this temple, a rhinoceros being tied with iron chains by a British soldier is one of them. This is a clever depiction of the historical fact that after the battle of Plassey in 1757C.E. the British had captured Bengal and Assam. A rhinoceros symbolizing Assam was used by the artist to give this suggestion. The architecture of the temple is a mixture of Rajasthani, Malwa and South Indian styles, but the Shikhara (tower over the sanctum) is missing today. This is a living temple and is looked after by a trust. It is open from 7am to 12noon and from 5pm to 9pm.</div></td></tr><tr ><th id="277990041R20"  class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" >21</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">20</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Mujumdar Wada</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr ><th id="277990041R21"  class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" >22</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">21</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Nana Wada</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/XSeLDeVkkpo">https://goo.gl/maps/XSeLDeVkkpo</a></td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width: 8580px; left: -1px;">Nana Wada
<br>One of the few remnants from Peshwa glory, Nana Wada is a stone’s throw from Shaniwar Wada. Built in 1780 by Nana Phadnavis, the Peshwa’s chief administrative officer, the Wada is a pale shadow of its former imposing self.
<br>
<br>Nana served Peshwa dynasty through four rulers, and it is to his credit that the Maratha Empire sustained and grew even after Madhavrao Peshwa’s death. The wada still includes most of its original architectural elements. The first floor still has an intact Diwan-Khana (living room), and a veranda with paintings on the walls. The delicately carved wooden ceiling, arches, Cypress-shaped pillars, Motifs of banana-flower, leave you mesmerized. A balcony with a dome-shaped ceiling, called ‘meghdambari’ augments the Wada’s stateliness.
<br>
<br>One of the earliest education propagators, Deccan Education Society began operating the New English School in this Wada in 1907. An annexe building was built for the school.The colonial influence on this annexe is visible and makes the Wada architecture visually interesting.
<br>
<br>The Wada currently houses a municipal school and a municipal office of old records. Restoration of some parts has been undertaken, which will reinstate the wada’s magnificence. Nana also built a regal Wada at Menavali near Wai, which is considered to be the perfect example of Wada architecture.</div></td></tr><tr ><th id="277990041R22"  class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" >23</div></th><td class="s0" dir="ltr">22</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Kesari Wada</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr"><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/smzuE6zCSek">https://goo.gl/maps/smzuE6zCSek</a></td><td class="s5 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width: 4772px; left: -1px;">Kesari Wada is located at Narayan Peth in Pune, Maharashtra. Gaikwads built the monument. It is very significant in terms of history. Prince of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaikwad used to live in this palace. Now the structure of the palace had been pulled down to renovate. Nightlong discussions were going in this building to overthrow colonial rule during the freedom struggle.
<br>
<br>Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak used to run his two newspapers, the Kesari, in Marathi and Maratha in English from Kesari Wada.
